This script sends a customized email to all persons in an excel sheet generated by google forms,
also attaching two photos and one PDF file that is generated based on a google sheets template.

This script follows this excel sheet template (marking with X unused fields):

(1)      (2)           (3)      (4)  (5)  (6)   (7)                            (29)                  (30)                (31)
 X   | FIRST_NAME | LAST_NAME |  X |  X |  X | EMAIL | 21 fields with X | PARTICIPANT_ID | HAS_RECEIVED_EMAIL_FIELD | CURRENT_DATE

The YES_NO is "NO" for all people that haven't yet received the email and will be changed by the script to "YES"
when that happens.

The script will generate a customized invoice for every person based on the template with the id: TEMPLATE_DOCS_FILE_ID
and attach it as a PDF in the email together with two logos and the email body.
