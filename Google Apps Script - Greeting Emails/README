This script sends a customized email to all persons in an excel sheet,
also attaching two photos and one PDF file.

This script is easily customizable for your own needs, as you only need to change the files ids, the
excel fields locations and the email content you want to send.

This script follows this excel sheet template (marking with X unused fields):

(1)      (2)           (3)      (4)  (5)  (6)   (7)                        (28)
 X   | FIRST_NAME | LAST_NAME |  X |  X |  X | EMAIL | 20 fields with X | YES_NO

You can easily change the position of the fields in the code. (eg. if you want the email column to be on the 1st position, etc...)

The YES_NO is "NO" for all people that haven't yet received the email and will be changed by the script to "YES"
when that happens.
